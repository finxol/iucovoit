## Presentation

This website, exclusively for students, is designed to connect drivers traveling to a specific destination on their own
behalf with passengers heading in the same direction in order to share the journey and its associated costs.

These general terms and conditions of use aim to regulate access to and usage of this website. We kindly invite you to
carefully read them. You understand and acknowledge that UniCovoit is not party to any agreement, contract, or
contractual relationship of any kind between registered students using this platform.

In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (
hereinafter "GDPR") and the "Data Processing and Liberties" law of 6 January 1978, personal data collected from users is
intended for UniCovoit and may not be transferred to third parties for commercial purposes. UniCovoit commits to not
sell or give away, whether free of charge or for a fee, the information collected through its website. However, due to
the nature of the Internet, some information, such as names and profile pictures, is accessible to all other users,
whether registered or not. Contact information provided is also shared with the passenger or driver involved in a
reservation.

## User Responsibilities

Students visiting this website agree not to use the information of other students accessible on UniCovoit, over which
they have no rights, for purposes other than organizing the friendly carpooling service offered. A registered person
also agrees not to contact other people for purposes other than carpooling (commercial offers, dating sites, etc.)

Students who have proposed a trip agree to respond to carpooling requests they receive through the website. In case of
accumulated non-responses to requests, UniCovoit reserves the right to suspend the User's account.

## Driver Commitments

The driver agrees to hold a valid driver's license and insurance that covers passengers. They also declare to use their
personal vehicle or a vehicle used with the express authorization of the owner, and in all cases, that they are
authorized to use it for carpooling purposes. In both cases, the vehicle must be in perfect working condition, and the
technical inspection must be up-to-date.

The driver commits to arriving at the prearranged meeting point with the passenger and dropping them off at the
agreed-upon destination. If unable to reach the meeting point at the scheduled time, they must inform passengers
immediately of the expected delay or trip cancellation. The driver must not make profits from the trips made, under
penalty of sanctions provided for in Article L.132-2 of the Consumer Code.

Passengers can report inappropriate user behavior to UniCovoit teams, who will then be able to implement access
restrictions to the service for the driver.

## Passenger Commitments

Passengers must respect the meeting point and time agreed upon with the driver, as well as the agreed-upon destination.
They must also adopt responsible behavior during the trip that does not compromise the driver's ability to drive safely.
They must also respect the cleanliness and integrity of the vehicle.

The passenger must inform the driver immediately if the scheduled meeting can no longer be held under the previously
agreed-upon conditions (cancellation, delay, etc.). They must also commit to paying the driver the agreed-upon price at
the time of booking.

Drivers can report inappropriate user behavior to UniCovoit teams, who will then be able to implement access
restrictions to the service for the passenger.

## UniCovoit's Responsibility

Given the volume of information provided by users, the control exercised by UniCovoit can only be limited. Consequently,
the user is solely responsible for the content they publish, and UniCovoit does not guarantee the truthfulness or
honesty of this content. More generally, UniCovoit cannot be held responsible for any direct or indirect damage that may
arise from the use or, conversely, the inability to use this website.

## Registration Conditions for the Platform

The use of UniCovoit is intended exclusively for students. Upon registration, the user declares and guarantees to be
enrolled in a higher education institution for the current year. Verification requiring a student email address will be
systematically carried out. Only after this will the account be created and access to UniCovoit authorized.

## Account Creation

UniCovoit allows each student to post advertisements and book trips. Users can view trips without being registered or
logged in on the website. However, they cannot post a carpooling ad or book a seat without first creating an account.

To create an account, the user can log in with Auth0, Microsoft, Google, or Discord. By logging in with one of the
latter three methods, UniCovoit will have access to, publish on its site, and store certain account information.

To register on UniCovoit, the user must have read and accepted these T&Cs.

When creating an account, regardless of the method chosen, the user agrees to provide accurate personal information that
reflects reality and to update it through their profile to ensure its relevance and accuracy throughout their use of the
platform.

You agree not to create or use, under your own identity or that of a third party, any other account than the one
initially created.

## Trip Pricing

In the context of a carpooling trip, the amount of participation in costs is determined by the driver, under their sole
responsibility. The price of the trip must be mentioned when posting a carpooling offer. It is strictly forbidden to
make a profit from using UniCovoit. Therefore, the driver commits to limiting the amount of participation requested from
passengers to the actual costs they incur for the carpooling trip.

UniCovoit does not handle trip payments. The passenger student agrees to respect the amount mentioned when confirming
their reservation. The payment method is to be determined between users. UniCovoit cannot be held responsible in case of
non-payment. However, if an offense is repeatedly reported, UniCovoit reserves the right to suspend for a determined
period or delete an account.

## Service Fees

UniCovoit does not take any commission on trip prices.

## Modification of T&Cs

UniCovoit may, at any time and without notice, modify these T&Cs to adapt them to the evolution of the website.

## Applicable Law

Both this website and the terms and conditions of its use are governed by French law, regardless of the place of use. In
the event of any dispute and after the failure of any attempt to find an amicable solution, French courts will have sole
jurisdiction to hear the dispute.
